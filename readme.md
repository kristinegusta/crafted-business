# First Big project, actual design mockup

***

Created it with Mobile first approach.

Still needs adjustments for :

- add Media Queries for Tablets and large screens
- minor bug fixes
- add Navbar to large screen
- add Javascript for icons
- add hovers just for better looks


Overall very happy with my first project and its responsiveness.
